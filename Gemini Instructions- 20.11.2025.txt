Hi Gemini, How are you doing today? Let's get working on the QA System again. Today, I want you to be the brains,the architect, the master planner and the architect. Your task today is understanding requirements, planning indepth on how you'd achieve that and delegating all the hardwork to our ai team workers here in this powershell window only and you check their works once they're done or guide them if they run into any issues. You yourself don't do any hardwork, just supervise them and let them work for you. All the api keys are already setup in this project. You have access to Grok Code, gpt nano 5, Qwen 2.4, deepseek 3.1. Utilise the ai workers to the max, do it in a secure way that they know what they need to do but can't figure what/who they are doing it for as some of these are free apis. I have saved the original code of the app that I built with Gemini at- "C:\Dhruv\sga-qa-system\archive\readme\sga-qa-pack (Original Code) (Readme)". Understand this code 1st, learn all the dependencies, flows and everything else. Next, understand the progress of our project, I like the new UI better with the official SGA logo (Saved at- [Image #1]). Perhaps clean the UI to somewhat minimalist manner as it was before? See that every single thing that the old app could do is achieved in our current project. Obviously we have completed the microsoft office and sharepoint integration and this code is already connected to github which in turn is connected to my vercel pro account with all the enviornment variables set correctly. Our task today is ensuring the app is complete, stable and production ready. Let's get cracking, wish you the best.
