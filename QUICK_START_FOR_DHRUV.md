# Quick Start - Hand Off to Copilot

## 🎯 What You Need to Do (2 minutes setup)

I've prepared everything for Copilot to guide you through the rest of the deployment. Here's how to hand it off:

---

## Step 1: Copy This Message to Copilot

Open Microsoft Copilot and paste this exact message:

```
Hi Copilot! I need your help completing the Microsoft 365 deployment of the SGA QA Pack application.

Claude has prepared everything for you. Please read this file and guide me through the remaining deployment:

C:\Dhruv\sga-qa-pack\COPILOT_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md

This file contains:
- Complete context of what's already done (Phase 1 - Azure setup)
- Detailed instructions for what you need to help me with (Phases 2-6)
- All the scripts, file locations, and credentials you need
- Step-by-step instructions for each phase
- Troubleshooting guide

Please start by:
1. Confirming you've read and understood the instructions
2. Showing me the current progress status
3. Beginning with Phase 2: Dataverse Schema Deployment

Let's start with Phase 2 - creating 12 custom tables in Dataverse. The table definitions are in:
C:\Dhruv\sga-qa-pack\scripts\Deploy-DataverseSchema.ps1

Ready when you are!
```

---

## Step 2: Follow Copilot's Guidance

Copilot will guide you through:
- ✅ **Phase 2:** Creating 12 Dataverse tables (30-45 mins)
- ✅ **Phase 3:** Creating 5 SharePoint libraries (15 mins)
- ✅ **Phase 4:** Deploying the Power App (30 mins)
- ✅ **Phase 5:** Setting up Power Automate flows (45 mins)
- ✅ **Phase 6:** Testing everything works

---

## Step 3: Work in the Background

Most of these tasks can run in the background while you work on other things:
- SharePoint library creation: 2 minutes of your time (script does the rest)
- Power App import: 5 minutes of your time (import process runs automatically)
- Power Automate: 10 minutes setup (flows run automatically after)

**Only Phase 2 needs your full attention** for 30-45 minutes.

## 📂 Key Files Copilot Will Use

All prepared and ready:
- `COPILOT_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Complete guide for Copilot

---

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

- **Phase 2:** 30-45 minutes (your attention needed)
- **Phase 3:** 15 minutes (can use script - 2 mins of attention)
- **Phase 4:** 30 minutes (5 mins of attention, rest is background)
- **Phase 5:** 45 minutes (10 mins setup, runs in background)
- **Testing:** 15 minutes

**Total hands-on time:** ~1 hour
**Total elapsed time:** ~2.5-3 hours (most running in background)

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

Just ask Copilot:
- "What should I do next?"
- "Can you explain this step again?"
- "What does this error mean?"

Copilot has all the context and troubleshooting information.

---

## ✅ You'll Know It's Done When...

- You can open the Power App on your phone
- Submit a test QA Pack
- See it appear in Dataverse
- Receive a Teams notification
- PDF is saved to SharePoint

**Ready? Copy the message above to Copilot and get started! 🚀**

## Alternative: If You Want to Wait for Claude

If you'd prefer Claude to continue after you're done with your background work, just let me know and I'll:
1. Wait for you to complete your other tasks
2. Then guide you through each phase myself
3. Answer any questions in real-time

Your choice! Either way works. 😊
