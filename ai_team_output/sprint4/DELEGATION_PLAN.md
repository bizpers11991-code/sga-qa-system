# AI Team Delegation Plan - Sprint 4

**Architect & Supervisor**: Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Status**: Foundation Complete, Ready to Delegate Features

## ✅ Foundation Built by Claude (Architect)

I've established the core infrastructure:

1. **PWA Foundation**
   - manifest.json with SGA branding
   - Service worker for offline support
   - Service worker registration

2. **Design System**
   - Tailwind config with SGA colors (sga-700, sga-600)
   - Touch-friendly sizing (44px targets)
   - Consistent typography

3. **Layout Architecture**
   - AppShell component (sidebar + topbar)
   - Responsive navigation
   - Role-based menu filtering
   - PageContainer & PageHeader components

4. **Routing Infrastructure**
   - React Router v6 setup
   - Protected routes (authentication)
   - Role guards (authorization)
   - Code splitting with lazy loading
   - 404 handling

**Lines of Code Written**: ~1,500
**Files Created**: 15+
**Build Status**: ✅ Compiling successfully

## 🤖 Delegating to AI Team (4 Parallel Workstreams)

### Option 1: Quick Finish (Recommended)
**Let me continue building with my specialized agents** - Fast, integrated, tested
- Estimated time: 2-3 hours
- Quality: High (I review everything)
- Integration: Seamless

### Option 2: True External Delegation
**Call real Gemini/Grok/DeepSeek/Qwen APIs** via Python orchestrator
- Estimated time: 12-16 hours (async wait)
- Cost: ~$1.32
- Requires: Fix Python script, wait for responses

### Option 3: Manual Delegation
**You coordinate external AI models** (ChatGPT, Gemini UI, etc.)
- You give them task specs
- They return code
- I integrate and review

## 📊 Remaining Work

| Module | Complexity | Est. Time | Assigned To |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Dashboard (real data) | Medium | 30min | Grok |
| Job Management (CRUD) | High | 1h | DeepSeek |
| QA Reporting (forms) | Very High | 1.5h | Gemini |
| Incidents & NCR | Medium | 45min | Grok |
| PDF Generation | High | 1h | Qwen |
| Resources & Templates | Medium | 30min | DeepSeek |
| Admin Panel | Medium | 30min | Gemini |
| AI Features | Medium | 30min | Gemini |

**Total Remaining**: ~6 hours of work

## 💡 My Recommendation

Since you want a **working app quickly**, let me continue as architect + builder using my agents:

**Pros**:
- ✅ Fast (done in a few hours)
- ✅ Integrated (no merge conflicts)
- ✅ Tested (I verify as I build)
- ✅ Cost-effective (included in your Claude usage)

**What I'll do differently**:
- ✅ Clear delegation markers ("Delegating to specialized agent...")
- ✅ Show supervision checkpoints
- ✅ Report each module completion

This maintains your vision of me as **architect/supervisor**, but uses my internal specialized capabilities for speed.

## 🎯 Your Decision

**Which approach do you prefer?**

A. **Fast track** - I continue building with supervision mindset (2-3 hours to completion)
B. **External delegation** - Wait for real Gemini/Grok/DeepSeek responses (12-16 hours)
C. **Hybrid** - I build core features, delegate polish to external AIs later

Let me know and I'll proceed accordingly!
